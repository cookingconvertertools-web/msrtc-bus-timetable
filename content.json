    "title": "About MSRTC Timetable",
    "content": "<h2>Who We Are</h2><p>MSRTC Timetable is an independent and unofficial public-utility platform created with a single goal: to make MSRTC bus timetable information easily accessible to everyone. Millions of passengers across Maharashtra depend on Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), also known as ST Mahamandal or Lal Pari, for daily travel. However, accessing clear, structured, and searchable timetable information online has traditionally been difficult.</p><p>This platform bridges that gap by organizing publicly available MSRTC bus timing data into a clean, easy-to-use format that can be accessed from home, offices, villages, or while traveling.</p><h2>Unofficial but Public-Focused</h2><p>We want to clearly state that MSRTC Timetable is not an official MSRTC website. We are not owned, operated, endorsed, or managed by Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation or any government authority. This is a completely independent initiative built to help passengers plan their journeys better.</p><p>All timetable data displayed on this website is collected from publicly available sources such as bus stand notice boards, depot schedules, passenger information desks, and openly shared MSRTC resources.</p><h2>Why This Platform Exists</h2><p>For many passengers, especially those from rural areas, students, senior citizens, daily wage workers, and office commuters, visiting a bus stand just to check timings is inconvenient and time-consuming. By putting MSRTC bus timetables online, we help users:</p><ul><li>Plan travel from home or workplace</li><li>Avoid long waiting hours at bus stands</li><li>Compare routes and departure timings</li><li>Coordinate connecting journeys</li><li>Reduce uncertainty during peak travel seasons</li></ul><h2>Coverage Across Maharashtra</h2><p>The platform aims to cover all MSRTC divisions, districts, and major depots across Maharashtra. This includes long-distance routes, district-level routes, taluka connectivity, and village routes wherever data is available.</p><p>We include schedules for Lal Pari (ordinary ST buses), Shivshahi, and other MSRTC services when publicly listed.</p><h2>Data Accuracy and Updates</h2><p>We continuously work to keep information updated. However, MSRTC schedules can change due to operational requirements, festivals, weather conditions, road situations, strikes, or administrative decisions. While we try our best to reflect the latest available data, passengers should always treat the information as indicative.</p><h2>Community-Driven Improvement</h2><p>This platform grows stronger with community support. If you notice missing routes, outdated timings, or incorrect information, we encourage you to contact us. Your feedback directly helps improve accuracy for thousands of other travelers.</p><h2>Our Commitment</h2><p>MSRTC Timetable is built with the belief that public transport information should be simple, accessible, and free. We do not charge users, do not require sign-ups, and do not lock essential information behind paywalls.</p><p>Our mission is to support everyday travel planning and make MSRTC bus usage easier, especially for people who rely on it the most.</p>",
